# workout-tracker

This application will allow a user to track their workouts.

The user will add a workout and be prompted to answer the question of cardio or resistence training. Once this has been answered, the user will then answer corresponding questions about their workout. The user wil input their distance, duration, sets, reps, etc. Once the data has been collected from the user, it will be stored in our MongoDB Database.

On click of the "fitness tracker dashboard" button, they will be able to see several graphs displaying information from their previous workouts from the previous week. This information is pulled from the database and displayed in a readable format organized by day and exercise type.

The user can add as many workouts as they would like, and they will automatically be stored by day and displayed back to the user.
